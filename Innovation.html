   <h1>Innovation</h1>
   <h3>INTEGRATED BUDGET REALISATION, FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION, AND FINANCIAL REPORT (2023)</h3>
   <p>Initiated and developed an Excel-based application to integrate budgeting, realisation, financial administration, and financial reporting within the department. The tool strengthen internal controls through monthly comparisons between cash budgets and actual realisation, enable cross-checking with the Regional Government Information System (SIPD) data, and includes an index system to track financial documents stored in Google Drive. It is an enhanced version of the 2022 Financial Realisation Report Tool.</p>

   <h3>DIGITISING FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION (2023)</h3>
   <p>Recognising the inefficiencies of relying on physical documents, I initiated the digitisation of our department’s financial administration in 2023. By utilising Google Drive for secure and organised storage, we significantly improved document accessibility and minimised the risk of loss or misplacement. This transition has proven effective, especially during financial inspections requiring timely document retrieval and cut printing expenses by 60%.</p>

   <h3>FINANCIAL REALISATION REPORT TOOL (2022)</h3>
   <p>While serving as Financial Administration Officer in 2022, I identified a gap in our department’s financial recording process, which relied solely on a system that still under development and prone to errors. To address this, I developed a simple Excel-based tool to systematically record each expenditure realisation. This tool not only streamlined the preparation of monthly financial reports but also served as a cross-checking mechanism to ensure the accuracy of financial data.</p>

   <h3>INTEGRATED CIVIL SERVANT SALARY AND A2 FORM FOR EMPLOYEE’S TAX REPORT (2020)</h3>
   <p>Developed an Excel-based application to record salary submissions and automatically generate Form A2, simplifying annual tax reporting for civil servants.</p>
   <hr>
   <h3>PROCUREMENT INSPECTION DOCUMENT TOOLS (2020)</h3>
   <p>Combined Excel VBA and Google Form to streamline the procurement inspection process during the COVID-19 lockdown. The system enabled Technical Implementing Officer (PPTK or Pejabat Pelaksana Teknis Kegiatan) to submit inspection request via Google Form, which were integrated through Excel VBA to automatically generate inspection documents.</p>
